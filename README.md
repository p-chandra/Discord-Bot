# Discord-Bot---Python

I made few comments indicating what each commands do.

The main purpose of this bot is to randomly generate 2 teams and move players accordingly to their appropriate chat

-Enter $custom
-type join if you want to play
-once everyone has entered, type done so the next step can begin
-the bot will then randomly select half of the people joined and move them to a different chat

There are few small codes that i wrote to help anyone new understand how things work. Play arround with it!
